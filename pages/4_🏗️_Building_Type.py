st.write(""" ### Building Type Impact ##  """)

st.write("""
The choice between buying an apartment or a house can have a significant impact on real estate prices. Generally, apartments tend to be more affordable than houses, but this can vary depending on factors such as location, size, and amenities. For example, apartments in highly desirable areas or those with luxury amenities may command higher prices than smaller houses in less desirable locations. Ultimately, the decision between an apartment or a house will depend on individual preferences, lifestyle, and budget, all of which can affect the value of real estate in the market.
