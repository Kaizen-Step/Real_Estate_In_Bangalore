We have a strong interest in anything involving machine learning, and the independent project gave us the chance to learn more about it and restate our enthusiasm for it. The ability to produce hypotheses, forecasts, and give machines the capacity to learn on their own is powerful and has an infinite number of potential applications.

The information includes many variables such as area_type, availability, location, BHK, society,total_sqft, balconies, bathroom, and price. The cleansing process started with the elimination of null values.As you can see in the image below, 41% of the values for the property society were null, hence the entire column was removed.

There some rows with range in area , and some with achre or other units presented. the values with range were replaced with average value ((Start + End)/2) and other units were erased. the price value presented in lakh (100,000 indian rupee) which we convert it to USD price with 1223.80 exchange rate to have better sense of price. The total square feet also converted to square meter.     
we devide the bangalore neighborhoods to 4 equal sections based on price per square meter.(the numbers came from describe command).

st.write(""" Linear regression is a machine learning technique that estimates the value of a dependent variable (Y) based on a given independent variable (X). This method creates a relationship between the input (X) and the output (Y) values. Linear regression is a widely recognized and comprehended algorithm in machine learning. There are various models of linear regression, including simple linear regression, ordinary least squares, Gradient Descent, and Regularization.

st.write(""" ####  Decision Tree Regression
""")
st.write("""  A tool is used to train a model with a tree structure to make predictions about future data and give meaningful continuous output. The key principles of decision trees, including Maximizing Information Gain, Classification trees, and Regression trees, are involved in the decision tree regression process. The fundamental concept of decision trees is that they are created by repeatedly dividing nodes into child nodes, starting with the parent node or root node. These child nodes can then become parent nodes for their own offspring nodes. To optimize the tree learning method, an objective function is established by identifying the nodes with informative features that maximize information gain.

Among various machine learning algorithms for regression, the Decision Tree method has the lowest loss and is highly regarded.

st.write(""" Generating a vast number of decision trees is a crucial technique for both classification and regression in machine learning. The fundamentals of decision trees are widely used for a range of machine learning tasks. Using decision trees is essential for data mining, as it remains consistent despite changes in scaling or other factors. To learn complex patterns effectively, the trees are grown to a great depth. Random forest, which involves training multiple deep decision trees on different portions of the same dataset and averaging the results, is a method used to improve accuracy, but it does come with a slight increase in bias and some interoperability issues.
