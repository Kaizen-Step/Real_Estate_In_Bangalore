st.write(""" ### Number of Bedroom and Bathroom Impact on Real Estate ##  """)

st.write(""" When it comes to real estate, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a property can have a significant impact on its price. Properties with more bedrooms and bathrooms are typically more expensive than those with fewer, as they offer more space and amenities for residents. In this sense, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a property can be seen as a reflection of its overall size and desirability, and can be a major factor in determining its market value. Whether you are buying or selling a property, it is important to consider the impact that the number of bedrooms and bathrooms can have on its price, and to use this information to make informed decisions about your real estate investments.
